              2020 was a year where most students & job-seekers found themselves
              in a rut when it came to securing a job. My team and I tried
              developing a new approach that would make the process of job
              searching a little bit easier and more systematic for them.

              The journey of creating Bluum was undoubtedly a group effort. From
              the early user research to the final high-fidelity model, all five
              team members tried to help with every aspect of the project.
              However for me, I was specifically assigned to the role of user
              research analysis. For this role, I was in charge of extracting
              valuable insights from user interviews and prototype testing,
              along with the creation of the user personas.

              Knowing that the job hunting field is broad and saturated, our
              team took the first step by formulating , “How could we adapt
              ourselves to this new setting of learning and working?” We already
              had ideas in mind on the different problems being experienced in
              this new work setting, but it is always best to hear from
              communities outside our team since this will provide a more
              accurate representation of the job hunting market at the time.

              The main community we targeted for our data gathering process was
              the UCSD student community because they best represented our
              future customers: people looking for employment. After sending out
              the survey and analyzing the responses, our team concluded that
              students at the time struggled with finding motivation to apply
              given the stressful environment of the pandemic, and needed
              innovative methods for job hunting.

              When it comes to the numerics of the surveys, 62% of respondents
              expressed their frustration about losing focus and not being
              productive when it comes to finding a job. Whereas the other 38%
              had a neutral or even positive feeling towards the matter. Here
              are some direct words from our respondents:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-primary">
              <li>
                “I feel very unmotivated and unproductive. It reminds me of bad
                memories from high school as I feel disconnected from friends.”
              </li>

              <li>
                “Down, but not entirely sure how to seek for these internships
                and jobs at home. I feel very uneasy and nervous about whether

              build their skillset to the limited opportunities out there in the
              job industry? Here are the main points we kept in mind moving

              When it came to our competitive analysis, we wanted to deepen our
              understanding of what already exists and what is still missing in
              job-hunting platforms. Right away, we realized that even though we
              started the project during the rise of the pandemic, job-hunting
              is a niche that is universal and has been around regardless of
              what is occurring in the world. But that does not mean we cannot
              develop a unique job-hunting concept that could add to the market.

              We decided to analyze five popular job-hunting platforms
              (LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, etc.) and our main takeaway was that
              the market lacked multifunctional platforms that catered towards
              student job seekers. This is our opportunity area: try to
              efficiently and systematically present well rounded skill sets
              (soft skills such as public speaking & hard skills such as coding)
              of students directly to recruiters.

              With the insights we have gained so far from our interview and
              competitive analysis, we composed two different personas with the
              first one being the users we are targeting. For our second
              stakeholder, we wanted to focus on the recruiters and their
              experience with the hiring process during the pandemic. With these
              two personas that show the main pain points, goals, and
              motivations for both the users and stakeholders, we could
              understand the problems from both perspectives.

            <p class="text-primary">
              Before diving headfirst and trying to create concrete solutions, I
              suggested to my team that we should rapidly prototype through the
              creation of storyboards. The reason being that they are quick to
              create and can yield a lot of information on what works and what
              doesn’t. In order to make this possible though, the team and I
              presented all of the six storyboards we created to twelve
              interviewees for their feedback. Based off of the twelve
              interviews, eleven responded with storyboard #1 being their
              favorite. This strong direction being displayed by our
              interviewees comes to show that the storyboard itself holds
              potential and could be used to jumpstart the product creation
              process.

              Our team has finally settled in a main direction, which is a

              opportunity to develop their skills while networking. In order for
              the users to be able to do this, we created and implemented four
              main features on the app that each plays a role and intertwine
              with each other.

                Our team also agreed right away with this tweak being made
                because users spend more time working on the actual projects
                rather than applying. As a result, the importance of having a
                project management feature outweighs that of demonstrating the
                user profile. However, our team still wanted to make sure that a
                user's profile could be accessed with a small icon on the top
                right.

              At this point in our project, we had the skeleton and meat of the
              project all in place. Now it was time to drape the skin on in a
              way that could enhance our product even further. As nearly half of
              our interviewees/ respondents had their jobs & internship
              cancelled due to the pandemic, people were feeling pretty upset
              and unmotivated. Taking this into consideration, we created a
              moodboard that gave off a warm feeling but at the same time still
              grabs the user’s attention enough to have them feel energized and
              attentive. We used warm orange/yellow colors to convey calmness,
              while mixing in purple and pink to stand out and have the users
              remain energetic.

            <p class="text-primary mt-70">
              By combining the two moodboard, we came up with the name called
              Bluum, in the hope of helping our users’ career bloom with more
              projects to practice on and later more offers from companies. We
              then created our color palette with purple as our major color, and
              then yellow and pink to add more dynamic to the theme. We then
              finished it off with deciding the typefaces and the buttons of
              different types and different states.

              On the final day of class, my team and I led a fifteen minute
              presentation that encapsulated our entire journey and what our
              final product has to offer. We started off by announcing our
              mission statement for the product, and followed it up with a
              demonstration of the user flow of the app. As the presentation
              came to an end, I could not help but to think to myself “How lucky
              I am to be on a team and work on an actual project like this?”
              Right then and there I realized, I just created a product that
              would allow other students to do the exact same thing.
